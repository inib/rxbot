# RXBot will be the base for my song request bot, mainly when streaming drums

in my studio I only have LTE connection and can't use a youtube song request system. I already use google music and this bot already brings all the tools I need.

planned changes to fit my needs:
* strip all functionality I don't need
* make youtube requests optional
* stop after each song and start an intermission file/loop (or trigger multiple songs in a row)
* create/publish playlists for each stream (all songs played, favorites)
* allow requests only from specific playlists
* vip request management
* share some data with streamelements
* easy API for streamdeck/midi control

*thanks to https://www.twitch.tv/rxbots for this amazing foundation*

RXBot is a song request bot for Twitch streamers: viewers can request songs in chat, and they will be added to a queue for the streamer to listen to while they stream. What makes RXBot unique is that it supports not only YouTube, but Google Play Music as well (though you must have a subscription to use that functionality). It's also very lightweight, so it will have virtually no impact on system performance.

We also plan on turning RXBot into a full-blown chatbot, so stay tuned!
